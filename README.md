LazyIterator
============

A repo that at some point might become a library.
Inspired heavily by Eric Nieblers Blog Post [Range Concepts: Delimited Ranges](http://ericniebler.com/2014/02/16/delimited-ranges/)

Currently this project requires a C++1y compiler, or rather a C++11 compiler which has provides automatic return type deduction for regular functions.
This may be relaxed in a future release, but I want to finalize the implementation of a couple of functions before doing that.
